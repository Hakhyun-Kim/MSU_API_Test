# ðŸ”§ Fix Missing Downloads on Release Page

## Quick Fix for v1.0.2 Release

Your build succeeded but the files aren't on the release page. Here's how to fix it:

### Option 1: Use the Upload Workflow (Easiest)

1. Go to: https://github.com/Hakhyun-Kim/MSU_API_Test/actions/workflows/upload-to-release.yml
2. Click **"Run workflow"**
3. Enter:
   - Release tag: `v1.0.2`
   - Workflow run ID: `16409631659` (optional, or leave blank for latest)
4. Click **"Run workflow"**
5. Wait 2-3 minutes
6. Check your release: https://github.com/Hakhyun-Kim/MSU_API_Test/releases/tag/v1.0.2

### Option 2: Download and Upload Manually

1. Download artifacts from the build:
   - [Windows .exe](https://github.com/Hakhyun-Kim/MSU_API_Test/actions/runs/16409631659)
   - Click on the artifact names to download
   
2. Go to your release page: https://github.com/Hakhyun-Kim/MSU_API_Test/releases/tag/v1.0.2
3. Click **"Edit"**
4. Drag and drop the downloaded files to the upload area
5. Click **"Update release"**

## Why This Happened

The build workflow created the executables but didn't upload them to the release because:
- The workflow was triggered manually (not from a tag push)
- The release upload step only runs when triggered by tags

## Permanent Fix (Already Applied)

I've updated your workflows so future releases will automatically upload files. The next time you use Push Button Release, everything will work automatically!

## Success! 

Once you complete either option above, your downloads will be available at:
- https://github.com/Hakhyun-Kim/MSU_API_Test/releases/tag/v1.0.2

And can be accessed from the README download buttons!
